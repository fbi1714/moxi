This is the code for the YouTube video series ([part 1](https://youtu.be/vT4-bvHCbE0), [part 2](https://youtu.be/uZDcWA8cCsw)), where we try to turn the microbit into an air quality monitor. The code for the end of each episode is in its respective directory.

## Prerequisites

Most of the projects going forward will be using `embassy` for concurrency, timekeeping, HALs & synchronization, so, best to [take the tour](https://youtu.be/pDd5mXBF4tY) to get familiar with it. And then there are the obligatory "getting started with embedded Rust" resources:
- [Getting setup for embedded development in Rust](https://youtu.be/TOAynddiu5M)
- [HALs & PACs : exploring the embedded Rust ecosystem](https://youtu.be/A9wvA_S6m7Y)
- [The Rust Book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/)

## Further Research

- [zero-to-async](https://youtu.be/wni5h5vIPhU) : building an async runtime from scratch
